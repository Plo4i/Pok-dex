# Pokedex React App

This is a Pok√©dex application built with React. The application uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about the Pokemons (e.g. Stats, Abilities, etc.), and also the Pokemons themselves. By clicking on a Pokemon card you will get the stats for the specific Pokemon. With the buttons, 'Previous' and 'Next' you can switch between different pages to see other Pokemons. Enjoy!
